                <p>Hello, I'm Mohith, a web developer based in Bangalore. I'm not just passionate about coding and web development; I'm also an aspiring entrepreneur. I've had the opportunity to work on a startup idea, although it didn't go as planned. This experience has taught me valuable lessons about perseverance and innovation. Despite the challenges, I remain dedicated to creating innovative digital experiences. When I'm not crafting code, you can find me experimenting with new web projects and frameworks. Feel free to explore my portfolio and get in touch!</p>
